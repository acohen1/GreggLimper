## Overview

Gregg Limper is a Discord assistant focused on grounded answers. Incoming guild traffic is cached, normalized, and selectively ingested into long-term storage so the bot can answer with recent context, previously shared links, and media summaries. Consent-aware retrieval, configurable storage backends (SQLite plus optional Milvus), and a modular formatter make the bot suitable for teams that need reliable recall without retaining unwanted data.

## Feature Highlights

- Full Discord slash command integration with automatic cog discovery (`src/gregg_limper/commands`).
- Channel-aware cache that memoizes formatted message fragments and guards ingestion with opt-in consent (`memory/cache`).
- Rich media understanding: text normalization, image/GIF captioning, URL summarization, and YouTube metadata/vision blending (`formatter`).
- Retrieval-augmented generation that merges cached history, semantic search results, channel summaries, and user profiles into a single prompt (`response`).
- Dual model support: OpenAI APIs by default with optional local Ollama fallback (`config/local_llm.py`, `clients/ollama.py`).
- Background maintenance that refreshes stale embeddings, keeps SQLite lean, and reconciles Milvus vector indexes (`memory/rag/scheduler.py`).
- Debug-first ergonomics: cached fragments persist to disk, and every completion request records context and message payloads for inspection (`debug_history.md`, `debug_context.md`, `debug_messages.json`).

## Architecture

### Event Flow

1. `gregg_limper.clients.disc.GLBot` wires Discord events to the bot.
2. `event_hooks.ready_hook.handle` hydrates the cache, validates Milvus (when enabled), and schedules maintenance.
3. `event_hooks.message_hook.handle` filters messages by configured channel IDs, updates the cache, logs memo diagnostics, and triggers the response pipeline when the bot is mentioned.
4. `event_hooks.reaction_hook.handle` currently logs high-signal reactions for future expansion.

### Message Formatting Pipeline

The cache relies on the formatter to transform raw Discord messages into stable fragments:

- `formatter.classifier` slices a message into text, images, GIFs, generic links, and YouTube URLs.
- Specialized handlers (`formatter/handlers/`) run concurrently to enrich slices:
  - `ImageHandler` downloads attachments and runs OpenAI vision to describe them.
  - `GIFHandler` scrapes Tenor/Giphy metadata, extracts a representative frame, and captions it with vision.
  - `LinkHandler` invokes the OpenAI web-search model for high-signal summaries.
  - `YouTubeHandler` queries the YouTube Data API and captions thumbnails.
  - `TextHandler` normalizes mentions and drops pure bot pings.
- `formatter.composer` merges fragment lists, assigns deterministic media IDs (`memory/rag/media_id.py`), and returns memo payloads ready for caching, retrieval, or prompt assembly.

### Retrieval-Augmented Memory

- `memory/cache.manager.GLCache` is a singleton that keeps per-channel buffers (`ChannelCacheState`) aligned with memo snapshots on disk (`memory/cache/memo_store.py`).
- `memory/cache/ingestion.py` checks user consent (`memory/rag/consent.py`) and only pushes memoized messages into long-term storage when users opt in.
- Long-term recall lives in `memory/rag`:
  - SQLite stores fragments, metadata, channel summaries, and user profiles (`memory/rag/sql`).
  - Vector embeddings are refreshed and stored via OpenAI (`memory/rag/embeddings.py`), with Milvus providing fast similarity search when `ENABLE_MILVUS` is true (`memory/rag/vector`).
  - `memory/rag/scheduler.start` runs periodic SQL and vector maintenance (embedding refresh, WAL compaction, Milvus sync/compact).
  - Opt-in backfill (`commands/handlers/rag_opt.py`) hydrates historical messages cooperatively using bounded concurrency and rate limits from `config/rag.py`.

### Prompt Orchestration

`response.pipeline.build_prompt_payload` assembles the final chat request:

1. `response.history.build_history` serializes cached messages into user/assistant turns up to `core.CONTEXT_LENGTH`.
2. `response.context.gather_context` pulls channel summaries, opt-in user profiles, and semantic memories by vector searching across configured channels.
3. Messages are merged with the system prompt from `response.system_prompt.get_system_prompt`, yielding a fully grounded `messages` list.
4. The bot calls OpenAI (`clients/oai.chat`) or a configured local Ollama model (`clients/ollama.chat`) and records the prompt artifacts for later debugging.

### Background Maintenance

- `maintenance.startup` / `maintenance.shutdown` offer reusable periodic task wrappers.
- `memory/rag/sql/sql_tasks` re-embeds stale fragments to enforce `EMB_MODEL_ID`/`EMB_DIM`.
- `memory/rag/sql/admin` prunes fragments older than a retention threshold and vacuums the database.
- `memory/rag/vector/vector_tasks` keeps Milvus in sync, removing orphaned vectors and requesting compaction when necessary.
- `memory/rag/vector/health.validate_connection` provides an early GPU capability check to catch Milvus configuration issues on startup.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer and a virtual environment manager (venv, pyenv, uv, etc.).
- Discord application with a bot token and required gateway intents enabled.
- OpenAI API key with access to the specified chat, embedding, image, and web models.
- Google Cloud API key for the YouTube Data API v3.
- Optional: Milvus 2.6+ with GPU support (see notebooks in `docs/`) and an Ollama server if you want to run the bot against a local model.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gregg-limper.git
cd gregg-limper
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -e .[test]     # editable install with test extras
# or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file and populate the secrets:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update all required keys (Discord, OpenAI, Google Cloud) and set `CHANNEL_IDS` to the numeric IDs you want the bot to monitor.
3. If Milvus is not available, set `ENABLE_MILVUS=0` to skip vector indexing.
4. To use a local Ollama model, set `USE_LOCAL=1`, `LOCAL_SERVER_URL`, and `LOCAL_MODEL_ID`.

### Run the Bot

```bash
python -m gregg_limper
```

During startup the bot will:
- Load environment variables from `.env` via `python-dotenv`.
- Validate Milvus connectivity when enabled.
- Hydrate the cache from Discord history for `CHANNEL_IDS`.
- Kick off RAG maintenance tasks on a recurring schedule.

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
pytest
```

Pytest targets are organized by subsystem (`tests/cache`, `tests/formatter`, `tests/rag`, etc.), and fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` provide Discord stubs plus temporary storage paths.

## Slash Commands

- `/help` — Lists all registered application commands.
- `/lobotomy` — Demonstration command that returns a playful acknowledgement.
- `/optin enabled:<bool>` — Toggle RAG consent for the caller. When enabling, the bot backfills recent history using bounded concurrency and notifies the user when ingestion completes.
- `/rag_status` — Report whether the caller is currently opted in to retrieval.

Additional commands can be added by creating new handlers under `src/gregg_limper/commands/handlers/` and decorating cogs with `@register_cog`.

## Development Notes

- **Cache persistence:** Memo snapshots live under `MEMO_DIR` (default `memory/cache/data`). Deleting the files will force the formatter to regenerate fragments on next startup.
- **SQLite storage:** The default database file is `SQL_DB_DIR`. Use `sqlite3` or `litecli` to inspect fragments, channel summaries, and consent tables. Maintenance jobs vacuum automatically, but you can run them manually via the `memory.rag` façade.
- **Milvus integration:** Ensure a GPU-capable index is available. The notebooks in `docs/` walk through deploying Milvus with GPU acceleration and restarting services. Set `ENABLE_MILVUS=0` if you only want SQLite recall.
- **Local LLMs:** When `USE_LOCAL=1`, completions are routed through Ollama. Embeddings and vision still rely on OpenAI unless you swap out handlers in `clients/oai.py`/`memory/rag/embeddings.py`.
- **Extending the formatter:** Add a new handler in `formatter/handlers`, update the media `ORDER` in `formatter/composer.py`, and implement `content_text` so RAG embeddings stay meaningful.
- **Command expansion:** Drop additional cogs in `src/gregg_limper/commands/handlers`, decorate with `@register_cog`, and they will sync automatically at startup.

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

- **Missing environment variables:** `config.core.Core` raises a `ValueError` listing missing keys early in startup. Double-check your `.env`.
- **Milvus connection errors:** `ready_hook.handle` runs `vector.health.validate_connection` and will log detailed GPU index failures. Disable Milvus or update credentials if validation raises.
- **Consent issues:** `/rag_status` reflects the persisted consent table. Use `/optin enabled:false` to purge stored fragments for a user (`memory/rag/__init__.py::purge_user`).
- **Prompt audits:** Each completion writes `debug_history.md`, `debug_context.md`, and `debug_messages.json` at the project root, mirroring exactly what was sent to the model.
- **Cache visibility:** Enable INFO logging to see `Cached msg ...` previews coming from `memory/cache/manager.py`. Use `GLCache().list_formatted_messages` in a REPL to inspect memo payloads.
